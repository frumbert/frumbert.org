Lynette.<br>
A name I hadn't heard before. I checked it twice.<br>
Lyntette (a combination of Lyn and Annette, perhaps?).<br>
I will never know, now.<p>

We were drunk-<br>
Or at least she was. I think I was still fully aware,<br>
Although isn't being drunk a bit like that?<br>
When you think you're right but you're not?<br>
Still, I remember as if it happened just now.<p>

We didn't do anything-<br>
Like everybody says they don't remember,<br>
But they 'had a good time' and probably 'got laid'<br>
And they can remember what it all would have been like,<br>
Even though they said they can't remember anything.<p>

We talked a bit, like you do-<br>
It wasn't like we were getting onto each other,<br>
Just that 'How are you?' type chat that you would have,<br>
Like sitting around waiting for the subway or in at the dentist,<br>
Talking about the weather and politicians and taxes and all that.<p>

I liked her, I really did, she had a great character-<br>
Yeah, she looked pretty, but I don't really look for that.<br>
 I do a bit, judge like that, but so does everybody.<br>
No, she was nice to chat with, over dinner and other's chatting.<br>
It was a sort of sit-down party, you see.<p>

She told me what she thought of me-<br>
It wasn't like what I thought of her.<br>
I really did like her, I latched onto her, this girl called Lynette.<br>
She said I should buy a life, get me a personality.<br>
Not in those words, but that's what they meant.<p>

She apologised later-<br>
I don't need apologies, I could see she meant it then.<br>
First impressions are good like this,<br>
Somebody you've known five minutes who says to you<br>
Just exactly what they think of you.<p>

That's why I liked her-<br>
Not because she was pretty, or because she apologised,<br>
Or because she wanted to sleep with me.<br>
Because she was herself,<br>
Made uninhibited by the alchahol, perhaps.<p>

I've never seen her since-<br>
I know my own ways, I think that's her good luck.<br>
If I see her again, I most likely won't talk to her.<br>
I'll let her be herself- this Lynette-<br>
Because that's why I like her.<p>
