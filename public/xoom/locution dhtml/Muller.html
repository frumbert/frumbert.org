The readout flickered. Tall red numbers in the old digital style cycled like a clock running backwards. Indeed, that's what it was. A countdown to a moment, and the moment was just about to arrive.<br>
"Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, one, five." A tallish figure stood counting the numbers. His rough voice barely audible over the electrical hum in the generator room.<br>
The figure glanced up nervously to look at the ceiling, attempting to calculate the amount of weight above him, for the room had been carved into a mountain and until recently, sealed seemingly from within. When he and his two-man-and-a-lady expedition were flown to Switzerland on order to search for this cave, he and his fellow explorers had not known exactly what to expect. They had been given an approximate position to within a hundred metres, but that was standard, and told to '...Bring him back here and don't ask any questions.' And for a straight hundred-thou clicks each paid direct to account, who asks questions?.<br>
Now the three of them stood in a cave in Switzerland staring at a row of meaningless digits on a machine that looked decades old.<br>
The digits were nearing zero.<br>
"Three, two, one. Zero." the three voices said in unison. Nothing. Perhaps a slight sound, but who cound be sure? The row of digits blanked out and a small green light flickered on. Then the electrical generators stopped and the cave became very silent.<br>
It was a full minute before anyone said anything. "Sarah? Uh-" Words just couldn’t grasp the situation. The one who had spoken looked at the female called Sarah, who shrugged but could say nothing.<br>
The room fell again into silence.<p>

It was approximately five minutes after the trio had turned away from the big black box that had displayed the digits and searched other parts of the small cavern that the tiny green light that had come on earlier started to flash. Abruptly, the generators started again and a hissing sound burst forth from the giant box. The trio, of course, got the hell out of there with excusable speed.<br>
Outside, it was a lovely, gentle day. Very typical weather for Switzerland, in fact, especially in the late summer months when everything was in bloom and not too cold. Not too far from the entrance of the cave there sat three shocked people, drinking in the relative peacefullness and radiant warmth.<br>
Then came the voice. It sounded tired but unrealistically satisfied. The trio stood. "What a night!"<p>
	
"So, you three like it here in Switzerland? Nice isn't it? You got the time?" He was reasonably built, short, had stubby limbs and a roundish head with dark brown hair. He appeared to be about twenty-five.<br>
Automatic response from Sarah: "Twelve midday." <br>
"Right on target. I'm Josh Muller. And the date?"<br>
"Huh? Muller?" Sarah, again.<br>
"Date? What's today? Should be thirteenth of September, ah, at twenty-fifteen, right?"<br>
"Yeah, uh, why?"<br>
"Good. Right on the dot. Twenty years, huh."<br>
"Ian," Said the tallest of the trio. "That's Sarah and Nash. We're, uh, representing William Atherton, who we belive you know."<br>
"Yeah. I wonder if he remembers me? You look sort of familiar, girl. Twenty years, huh.
'S along time, y'know. Yeah, anyway, you don’t seem to wan't to know about me, huh." Josh was talkative to the point that he overrided the conversation, not allowing comments to be added by his avid listeners.<br>
"We were told not to ask questions. Part of the deal, us being here to greet you and all." Nash said. He had not said anything since their arrival in the cave. He appeared to have no idea of what was happening around him. Reaching into one of the many top pockets on his faded vest, he withdrew a small package, aproximately the size of a short pencil. "Draw, man?" He offered the object to Josh, who refused. Nash shrugged and bit the stick in half, then shortly let out a long explosive breath. A smile washed across his face.<br>
"We go, then? Melbourne still?" Josh said, smiling. He looked very happy.<br>
"Sydney. To Mr. Atherton, in Sydney. He moved up from Melbourne some years ago. Didn't you know?" Sarah questioned, startled by this odd fellows wandering conversation.<br>
"How could I?" He said it such a way that it ended the conversation altogether. When they eventually left the cavern, Josh closed the great iron door with a magnetic keycard that was still inserted in the small slot, patted the door once, then took the card and left with the others.<p>

"Do you notice something really, like, wierd about this guy? Like he's fried out on kickback or something? Like, he's been staring at all the stuff in here all the way and actually talking to the AI's and that, asking them dumb questions like a kid." Nash and Ian sat back in their chairs and made passed the time discussing the oddball character sitting a couple of rows ahead of them with Sarah.<br>
"Yeah, and Mr Atherton has treated him kinda out of it by getting us over there to get him. Like, he's real special or something, y'know it. Yeah and the way he acts. Like, Atherton could’ve just prescenced him from Australia, right?"<br>
"Yeah. And he didn't. He sent us-"<br>
Out the small window beside the two, towards the back of the plane, a black dome of nothingness warped over a slightly curved blueish surface. The bright white sun hung motionless, almost coldly, against the blackness of space.<p>

Sarah and Josh were involved in conversation, too. Josh was attempting to learn more of everything and Sarah couldn’t resitst the temptation of it. She had to know more about this remarkable character that seemed to know nothing about anything. It had been hard explaining that the aircraft was riding on the uppermost layer of the atmosphere. People just knew that kind of thing, she thought.<br>
"And the atmosphere? The ozone layer and all that?"<br>
"Ozone layer? Yeah right! Like, occasional molecules here and there, if that. Like, gone. Man, don’t you prescence or nothin'?" She was astounded, still.<br>
"Sorry. Um. Look, you do wanna know about me, yeah? Yeah."<br>
"Well, we were told-"<br>
"You aren't asking, are you? I will tell you, 'cos you seem like a nice girl. Well. Where to start, eh?" He fiddled with the little switches on a console in front of him for a while while thinking. A light came on. "Well. About two years back... no, sorry, twenty-two years back now I was in R&D for a little data storage firm, DataLine, and we were doing stuff on ionising molecules for storage in a magnetic field, and we were using a smasher to break the atoms and then ionising with a laser and storing them in a field. Well, we actually did it after about a month of trials in the lab and a year or two out before that when I was doing Engineering at Uni. We got an up-an-running system that was the first in the world for nanodata storage. Anyway, we were fooling around with larger systems one time and we found that they were dissapearing right there inside the field, and all that was left was this bright light- an energy discharge from the smasher which was greater than the expected output of the system. Anyway, it turned out that thise large particles were being accelarated to such a point that their mass was naught and they became energy, right?"<br>
"Yeah, basic relativity stuff. Kids do that kinda stuff at school. No big deed."<br>
"Yeah, that right? Anyway, we- kids didn't do that sort of thing twenty years back, did they?"<br>
"No, s'pose not, huh. Yeah, get on with it. We halfway there already."<br>
"Yeah, well we were the first to do it. Ever, right. Then we got the idea of storing the energy, like a battery. And that wasn't hard. Well, I suppose it was hard, really, but energy isn't that hard to store anyway. Yeah, so when we had it stored, we thought of reversing the process, getting that energy back to matter and back into the molecules as they were. Only this way that we could only store it for about twenty years, after that-" He spread his hands. "So we put something in there for twenty years."<br>
"Yeah? No shit? Did it work?"<br>
"I'm here today as testimony." He spoke slowly as to convey the meaning.<br>
"What!" She tried to stand up but her seatbelt held firm.<br>
"You haven't guessed?"<br>
"I've guessed. I've bloody guessed. No way you'd reckon I believe it, though."<br>
"We can go back and I'll show you how it's done. Quite simple really. Took a big nut to figure it all out back then. I presume computers have come along way since... In twenty years." The words sank in. Sarah went very quiet for a long time. Her ears popped. Then, when the shuttle was re-entering the high atmosphere and the craft began to shake, she finally spoke.<br>
"Twenty years, huh? You would have gone in there about five years old."<br>
"Nah. I went in there the same age that I am now minus a few hours. I have no memory of the past twenty years. The last thing I remember was it was the thirteenth of September in good 'ol nineteen ninety five, and I was having my last lunch with my wife, Paula. Yeah, she always said I should've never wanted to do it. She probably never forgave me for leaving her like that. We had big arguments and seperated over it. She was pregnant, but this was the chance of a lifetime, you know. Something I dreamed about from when we first got right into it."<br>
Sarah had gone almost completely into shock. She believed the full story mainly because she knew most of it to be true. She could recall hearing something about it, her mother had spoken of it when she was little, something about particle accelarators and outstanding energy sources. Yes, she remembered now and groped for an understanding that had to be coincidence. This was way too wierd to be true.<br>
Josh stared out the window, thinking. "Huh. I wonder why I didn't think of that before."<br>
"What's that?"<br>
"Energy can be duplicated, like the data in a database. It can be copied. Then take it back to it's origional form and you've-"<br>
"Cloned the origional." Sarah finished the sentance. It's like data, she thought. It can be copied and reprinted as many times as you need, all just like the origional.<br>
"We could've been so rich just by putting in one dollar."<p>
	
When the plane landed and the transmite ground shuttle had brought them to as near as it could to William Athertons' home in North Sydney, Ian and Nash said their farewells and left. Neither Sarah nor Josh had spoken a word of their conversation to the other two because Sarah thought that they would tell everyone else. A few minutes later, they were at the door and Sarah inserted a small plastic card.<br>
A smooth synthetic voice spoke seemingly out of nowhere. A computer-generated face appeared on the door like a moving hologram, moving in time with the voice to give the impression of speech. "You and your guest may enter. Mr Atherton is in the holobay, waiting your arrival. The time is five twenty two."<br>
They entered. The first thing Josh did was look around, having not even dreamed of many of the appliences that adorned the house. Finally, they reached the room that was known as the Holobay, a room much like an office but with hologramatic representations of data and clients with William Atherton sitting in the middle. Upon knocking, the virtual images vanished and Sarah and Josh walked directly in, behind Mr Atherton’s field of vision. They stood silent for a few moments.<br>
"Billy?" Josh was the fist to speak. "It works."<br>
Of course, the two great friend greeted each other and commented about all manner of things, carefully forgetting about the atomic freezer far away in Switzerland. It was not for some time that Mr. Atherton actually introduced Sarah formally to Josh. She had stood with a look of joy on her face, as if she had finally found something she had been searching for.<br>
"Josh, this is my step-daughter, Sarah Atherton, more appropriately at this time, Sarah Muller."<br>
Josh Muller stared openly at his daughter. She said nothing, only smiled.<br>
