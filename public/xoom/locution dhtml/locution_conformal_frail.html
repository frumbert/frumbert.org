Frail Age<p>

She wakes early– crack of dawn<br>
Tea in the hand, a good book in the other<br>
She doesn't like the book<br>
But it gets read anyway because<br>
Somebody told her that it is a good book<p>

The tea goes cold, as tea does<br>
She sips, sips and spits it back out<br>
The crack of dawn has come and gone<br>
The sun is rising up off the ground<br>
She must rise up off the bed again<p>

It is now midmorning<br>
The kitchen is cleaned, the clothes washed<br>
The radio is off. The TV is off. The lights are off<br>
The food in the fridge is off–<br>
The refrigerator is broken<p>

The man has come to take it away<br>
It is now raining, midday, lunchtime<br>
Lunch is not cold<br>
On a radio, somewhere,<br>
A man talks about the weather<p>

It is afternoon<br>
The dry clothes are wet again, the rain<br>
Splashing down to destroy her labours<br>
She stops, picks up her book, sits<br>
She reads the book, but she does not enjoy it<p>

She has lost her glasses<br>
She searched the house through<br>
She cannot remember what she is searching for<br>
She reads the book, drinking from a cup<br>
The tea is cold<p>

It is noght, early enough still to watch the news<br>
The refrigerator has not returned<br>
Dinner from a packet<br>
The clothes dry, the washing up done<br>
She takes her hot tea and goes to bed<p>

She recalls the day<br>
Pondering her achivements<br>
She has gaps in her memory, holes in the head<br>
'Oh how like is so droll, waiting to die' She cries, silent<br>
'When you're too old.<p>
