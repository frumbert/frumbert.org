You've all heard of WYSIWIG. Now Microsoft(r) have brought out a New and Improved(tm) Acronym - WYGIWYG (Pronounced WiggyWig). It Means: What You Get Is What Your Given. Shortly after their release, a patch came out for the Acronym -  WYGIWYG-ANGW. They'd added What You Get Is What Your Given - And No Good Whinging.

Two trains leave at 10:45 a.m. on a Thursday. 
One is heading west from Los Angeles 
traveling at 75 miles per hour. The other is 
heading east from New York traveling at 52 
kilometers per hour. The one heading west 
stops twice to pick up cargo. The one 
heading east stops three times for passengers. 
Which train is painted blue?

"Twisted!" is an intriguing adventure from Ray

bizarre fantasy world filled with strange

floats or doubles, sin, cos, tan, pow, exp, log 
etc. in inner loops. They are all very 
slow. (float) and (double) are fast on all types.

how many moths does it take to change a light bulb?
nobody knows, but they just keep on trying.

Q: How many Zen masters does it take to change a light bulb? 
A1: Two. One to do it and one not to. 
A2: "One to change and one not to change" is fake Zen. The true Zen answer is Four. One to change the bulb. 
A3: Zen Masters don't need light bulbs because they carry their own light with them. 
A4: Three. Two to fetch the wood and one to enlighten the novice. 
A5: A tree in a golden forest. 

Milla Natasha Jovovich was born on 
December 17th, 1975 in Kiev, Ukraine, a city 
of approximately 1.7 million people. Her family 
moved to the U.S. when she was five years 
old. She does an excellent job balancing 
modeling, acting, and singing/writing 
songs. She has been in many ads, both print 
and television. She has been in many high 
profile advertisements. Milla is not one to 
be camera shy. She repeats over and over in 
interviews that she is true to herself. 

Maybe you're being a bit too self-centered 
these days. Your every exploit does not 
necessarily bear repeating. Other people are 
leading perfectly interesting lives that have 
nothing to do with yours.

And in the beginning the world was borne unto 
the Stars And the world said unto the Stars I 
have but one question of thee I 
wish to understand Does the ocean envy the 
fish? Hearken unto me Mother Let god fall 
upon my shore that enlightenment may 
fall my way This is all I ask And the Universe 
relented And did send a star from the heavens 
down to the Earth carrying the seed 
to her shore Be well mother Earth said the 
Universe For you bear my children
