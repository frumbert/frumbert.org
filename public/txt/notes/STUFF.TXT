The scientific motivation for DiVA is to address the representation and recognition of these complex forms of appearance change in image sequences. This will require the development of new representations of motion (e.g. using wavelets) and new models for characterizing spatio-temporal image variation (e.g. using tools from statistical learning theory). It will also necessitate new algorithms for recovering and recognizing these complex forms of appearance change in image sequences (e.g using Bayesian reasoning and random sampling techniques). For both recognition and synthesis we need to capture the distinctive spatio-temporal properties of the phenomena.

When Plumbing: A good flush beats a full house everytime.

There just happened to be a lawyer convention and a plumber convention in Oregon at the same time. There was a party of three plumbers and three lawyers leaving California and taking the train to the conventions. As they were standing in line for tickets, the lawyers noticed that the plumbers only bought one ticket. The lawyers bought their three tickets and boarded the train but watched the plumbers to see how they were going to get by with only one ticket.
After boarding, the three plumbers squeezed into a restroom. Finally the porter came by and knocked on the door as he said "Ticket please". The door cracked open and an arm reached out and gave the porter the ticket.
After the conventions, the lawyers decided to do the same thing so they only purchased one ticket. However they noticed the plumbers didn't purchase any tickets at all. They weren't too concerned though because -hey- they were saving some bucks right? Well, they all boarded the train and the lawyers packed into a tiny restroom. After a few minutes, one of the plumbers came by and knocked on the door saying, "Ticket please."

About yourself:
I'm a technical person by nature - a 'fix-it-guy' for computers fullfills my day dob (and consumes my nights, more oft than not). Being of a technical nature I like science fiction style works, of the more whacky, "out there" kind. Myself, I write in dribs and drabs, a sentance here, a chapter there, never a whole thing go to woe, drafting several times before writing the "ending".. I also write a bit of freeform poetry - zen explorations of the self, interludes of thought, crazed expression. Always write once and forget, never reworked. I'm quite interested in creating 'interactive' fiction, where plot is semi-fixed but characters are free to change interactions depending on key events.
Type of stories you write: Science Fiction

[a] the underlined letters have the accent.
[i:] means 'i' like in the word 'thing' (like someone's crying)
[,h] is something middle between 'g' and 'h'
['] makes the letter before it to sound very mild, gentle,
for example "na" - 'n' is hard, "ni" - 'n' is soft
"set" - 's' is hard, "see" - 's' is soft,
so in the word "vsu" - 's' is hard,
but in the word "vs'u" - 's' is soft.
So I've made something like my own system of sound notation.
If somebody can propose better one I'll rewrite the lyrics in it.

how many moths does it take to change a light bulb?
nobody knows, but they just keep on trying.

Q: How many Zen masters does it take to change a light bulb?
A1: Two. One to do it and one not to.
A2: "One to change and one not to change" is fake Zen. The true Zen answer is Four. One to change the bulb.
A3: Zen Masters don't need light bulbs because they carry their own light with them.
A4: Three. Two to fetch the wood and one to enlighten the novice.
A5: A tree in a golden forest.
