            <h3>Janison (previous work)</h3>

            <p>I worked for over a decade at a local company known as <a href="http://janison.com.au">Janison</a>, who produced [then] an e-learning management and authoring tool (LMS) known as <b>Toolbox</b> (later called <b>Janison LMS</b>). Janison have since moved out of the LMS space.</p>

            <p>Some of the key areas I developed (often by myself) in the LMS system were:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#portals">portals</a>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a href="#chat">collaboration</a>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a href="#lms">learning & assessment management</a>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a href="#sql">database optimisation</a>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a href="#helpdesk">support and helpdesk</a>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>I parted ways as their company direction changed, preferring to work in smaller organisations without top-heavy management.</p>

            <h3>McDonagh Computers (early days)</h3>

            <p>In the late 1990's, I was a computer repair technician working for a Tamworth based organisation that sold and repaired computers. I started as the single technician in a 4 person business, and helped build it up to a 20+ staff organisation across 3 towns in the region.</p>

            <p>My skills in particular were dealing with on-site repair (out of town, often on mining sites, factories, depots, or other small businesses) without access to many spare parts, and thus I learned to improvise fixes and always left a site with a workaround where a final solution was not possible. I worked with AS400 systems, Windows NT networks, Novell Netware LAN's, Windows 3.11 networks, and even the crazy phone-cable jigs that Apple had before Ethernet solved everything.</p>

            <p>I also was the region's only "Mac" guy, servicing everything from re-soldering ancient Apple 2's through to repairing the flyback transformers in high-end RasterOps monitors, plus laptop repairs, data recovery, warranty replacements, you name it.</p>

            <p>Late in the days of McDonagh, I also got into Perl-based web programming - the early days of the dynamic web.</p>

            <p>I left McDonagh's to join the startup Janison, who offered further development of my programming and design skills.</p>

        <p>I wanted to have a site that reflected my roots in the web. I started <i>using</i> the web in 1992 on the NCSA Mosiac web browser, and <i>coding</i> it in 1995, when most of the web looked like this page.</p>
