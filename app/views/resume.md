#Current Projects
I made a new web site for my boys' old preschool: [Lower Bucca Preschool](http://www.lowerbuccapreschool.com/).

I created a couple of new web apps for simplifying building SCORM courses (a standard of content re-usability in the world of eLearning). Check out my [Video Scormification Ninja](http://video.scormification.ninja/) and my [Document Scormification Ninja](http://document.scormification.ninja/).

I also created [CourseSuite.Ninja](http://coursesuite.ninja), which ties in with our [FastSpring](http://fastspring.com) store for doin SaaS stuff.

You can check out [my github repos](http://github.com/frumbert/) here. The most popular one is currently [Wordpress 2 Moodle](https://github.com/frumbert/wp2moodle--wordpress-), a single sign on solution between Wordpress and Moodle.



#Employment history
I've linked to my current resume [here](https://frumbert.org/tim_st_clair_resume.pdf).

##Avide / Coursesuite
I currently work part time at [CourseSuite](http://coursesuite.ninja/) / [Avide Elearning](http://avide.com.au/), producing e-learning materials, skinning Moodle sites, crafting SCORM packages, and integrating elearning into corporate products.

Some of our work includes products and development for:

* [Avant](http://www.avant.org.au/Risk/IQ/) - we have implemented over 60 courses and provided a custom themed Moodle installation with rich jQuery-based video and interactions
* [Aspen Medical](http://www.aspenmedical.com.au/) - skinning and integrating their Moodle and other portal sites (single sign on, event notifications, that sort of thing).
* [Sinclair Knight Merz](http://www.globalskm.com/) - put together a learning package for their CourseMill LMS that demonstrated their various communication technologies and tools
* [Clinicians Matrix](http://www.cliniciansmatrix.com/) - a moodle site development featuring a custom skin, wordpress single-sign on authentication and web services, and CPD tracking portal.
* [International Teacher Training Academy (Australia)](http://www.ittacademy.net.au/) - implementation, advice and custom design work for this Moodle-based learning provider.
* [Enterprise & Training Company Ltd](http://etc.coursesuite.com.au/) - [now-defunct] Moodle-based portal with custom skin, PayPal sales integration, and customisations to environment.

I also have created an internal webapp for rapid content authoring for Avide / CourseSuite that significantly cost-reduces the content authoring process. What used take 6 weeks now takes about 2 days. It's better.

##Janison
I worked for over a decade at a Coffs Harbour company known as [Janison](http://janison.com.au/), who produced [then] an e-learning management and authoring tool (LMS) known as Toolbox (later called Janison LMS). I was a graphic artist, ux designer, a front- and back-end coder, a manager, a program manager, a stream manager, a helpdesk guy, a DBA, an analyst, marketer, office design stylist, and general all-things-doer. I had many hats, often in a day, as you do when there's 20-odd programmers all asking for your input... Janison have since [apparently] moved out of the LMS space, meanwhile adding a bunch of staff and a bunch more middle managers. I parted ways as their company direct[ion]ors changed, preferring to work in smaller organisations. Less stress, less politics, more family time.

##McDonagh Computers
In the late 1990's, I was a computer repair technician working for a [Tamworth based organisation](http://web.archive.org/web/20001015023245/http://www.mcdonagh.com.au/) that sold and repaired computers. I started as the single technician in a 4 person business, and helped build it up to a 20+ staff organisation across 3 towns in the region. My skills in particular were dealing with on-site repair (out of town, often on mining sites, factories, depots, or other small businesses) without access to many spare parts, and thus I learned to improvise fixes and always left a site with a workaround where a final solution was not possible. I worked with AS400 systems, Windows NT networks, Novell Netware LAN's, Windows 3.11 networks, and even the crazy phone-cable jigs that Apple had before Ethernet solved everything. I fixed telephones, soldered power supplies for dead Amigas and Apple II's, [degaussed monitors](http://www.dansdata.com/danletters009.htm), electrocuted myself frequently, fixed laptops, recovered deleted files, drove drunken staff home, prepared coffee, pulled all-nighters: if there's a tech job, I've probably done it. I left the company to work on the early days of dynamic web pages.

##Computer Graphics College, the
Sydney, 1996. The dawn of the term "Multimedia", when CD's were called CDROM's and came in [caddy's](https://www.google.com/search?q=CD+CADDY&tbm=isch). I taught basic 3D (then using Infini-D and Lightwave) and some Macromedia Director coding to a bunch of graphic designers (these guys don't know code, and seemed to like it that way). [The college](http://www.cgc.com.au) also taught desktop publishing (Quark Xpress) and video production (Adobe Premiere), and I helped out in these classes when technical questions came up. I also managed the physical network, including the nightmare of integrating their many Mac Quadras and LC's with various Windows PC's on the network - getting them all to print, and to share files and so on. I'm so glad Windows so easily integrates these days. No, seriously, surely it does, right? Right?
