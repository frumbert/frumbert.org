#Game ideas

They were notes and ideas when I was entertaining the idea of joining a MMORPG programming group (back in my [TrueVision3D](http://www.truevision3d.com/forums/index.php) days). The principal game idea was that the game would be based on crafting and exploration of world and story, rather than monster battles. Never got off the ground significantly, but I still think the idea is workable, for a different gamer market than you normally associate with massively multiplayer games.

<?php
$files = glob('txt/mmo/*.{odt,txt}', GLOB_BRACE);
foreach($files as $file) {
    echo "* [/$file](http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffrumbert.org%2F" . urlencode($file) . ")\n";
}
?>

I've linked these through Google Viewer, so you should be able to read them online.
