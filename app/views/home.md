#Hi, I'm frumbert.

I'm a web coder living in Toormina, NSW, Australia, which is next door to Coffs Harbour and is much less noisy. At night time I hear crickets and frogs, not air-brakes and sirens.

I started using *email & telnet* in 1989, the *web* in 1993-ish on the NCSA Mosiac web browser, *irc* in 1994, and *coding HTML* in 1995. In 1996 I got into *Macromedia Director*, then afterwards *FutureSplash* (later renamed Flash), then *Javascript* and *Perl*. From then on my programming career has led me through *classic asp*, *dotnet / mvc*, *java*, *nodejs* and *php*.

I currently write javascript web apps, do custom moodle programming, and some web design (and make Minecraft mods!) - mostly I code.

You could [google frumbert](https://www.google.com/search?q=frumbert) and track down all the things I've missed below - I've been using this nic since the early 1990's, so it's pretty much entrenched in the internet by now.

#Wayback

You can nose about in my old sites using the [Wayback Machine](http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://frumbert.org) ([more here](http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://poi.coffs.org/poi/default.asp), [even more](http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://daleks-of-god.net/DaleksOfGod/index.asp)). **If** you're adventurous, you can check out my online [site archive](/xoom/default.html) or its [predecessor](/xoom-old/default.html), which are both from the deep dark days of the web when you did your animations with hacky gif files or java applets. There's some jaw-dropping design in there (probably not the good sort).
